### **One of the most popular games we played as kids🧒 was Hangman. Whenever we have free time, let's spend it with our cousins or friends 🤝, one of the first games that came to mind was hangman. In fact, this was one of the games/activities with word-related topics of a subject to go when the teachers thought of a fun activity to conduct in class while keeping the silence and decorum of the room.**
